# Sakura CardCaptor API âœ¨

![Header](./assets/sakura.jpg)

## This API (and it's readme) were highly inspired by the [sakura-card-captor-api](https://github.com/JessVel/sakura-card-captor-api).

The end of the Heroku free tier resulted in it's halt, so I decided to recreate it and host it as an AWS Lambda function. The data was scraped from the [Sakura Card Captor Fandom Page](https://ccsakura.fandom.com/) and the script used is included as well.

| HTTP METHOD | GET             |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| cards       | gets all cards  |
| card        | gets card by id |

## /cards

This call will return a maximum of 52 cards. The default is 52.

-   Example of the response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Arrow",
    "desc": "The Arrow is a Clow Card with the power to fire a volley of magic arrows. It is under The Firey under the power of the Sun, Cerberus, and Western Magic.",
    "clowCard": {
        "front": "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ccs/images/8/80/ClowArrow.jpg",
        "back": "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ccs/images/7/7b/CCS_Clow_Card.jpg"
    },
    "sakuraCard": {

    },
    "kanji": "çŸ¢",
    "katakana": "ã‚¢ãƒ­ãƒ¼",

    "hierarchy": "The Firey",
    "magicType": "Western Magic",
    "temperament": "Aggressive"
  },
    { ... },
    { ... }
]

```

These are the supported query string parameters:

| Parameters | Description                                                             |
